Project Overview: Django URL Shortener
Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to shorten long URLs into manageable short links and provides seamless redirection when those short links are accessed. This will involve a combination of backend development using Django, database modeling, and basic front-end interface design.

Project Requirements
Functional Requirements
Shorten URL: Users can input a long URL and receive a shorter version.
Redirection: When the short URL is accessed, it redirects the user to the original URL.
Uniqueness: Each shortened URL should be unique.
Persistence: Store original URLs and their shortened versions in a database.
Scalability: The system should handle multiple requests efficiently.
Non-Functional Requirements
User-friendly Interface: The application should be simple and easy to use.
Reliability: URLs must always redirect accurately without errors.
Security: Prevent malicious URLs from being entered or used.
Project Workflow
To approach this project methodically, follow these steps:

1. Requirements Gathering
Understand the core functionalities:

Input form for entering a long URL.
Display a short URL after submission.
Handle redirection when the short URL is accessed.
2. Plan Database Schema
Define a URL model:
original_url: Field to store the long URL (e.g., models.URLField).
short_code: Unique code for each URL (e.g., models.CharField).
created_at: Timestamp for record creation (e.g., models.DateTimeField).
3. Set Up the Environment
Install Django and create a new project and app.
Set up the database (SQLite for simplicity or PostgreSQL for production).
4. Develop the Backend
URL Shortening Logic:
Create a function to generate a random unique short code.
Check the database for collisions.
Redirect Logic:
Use Django's get_object_or_404 to find the original URL based on the short code.
Redirect using Django's HttpResponseRedirect or redirect() method.
5. Build the Frontend
Form Page:
Create a basic HTML form to accept the long URL.
Show the shortened link after submission.
Redirection Page:
No visible page is needed here; handle redirection automatically.
6. Routing
Define two primary routes:
Home Page: Handles form submissions and short URL generation.
Short URL Route: Captures the short code and redirects to the original URL.
7. Testing
Test the application manually:
Enter valid and invalid URLs.
Check redirection accuracy.
Ensure uniqueness of short codes.
Write automated unit tests for:
URL generation logic.
Redirection functionality.
Error handling.
8. Deployment
Prepare the project for deployment:
Use Django's DEBUG = False for production.
Serve static files using tools like whitenoise.
Deploy to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or PythonAnywhere.
Milestones
Week 1: Environment setup, database schema, and backend logic.
Week 2: Frontend form and routing.
Week 3: Testing and debugging.
Week 4: Deployment and adding optional features (analytics, expiration, etc.).
Optional Features for Future Expansion
Analytics:
Track how many times a short URL is used.
Custom Short Codes:
Allow users to specify their own short codes.
API:
Build a REST API using Django REST Framework for external use.
Admin Panel:
View and manage all shortened URLs.
Your Approach
Understand Each Step: Instead of copy-pasting code, implement each piece step by step and understand why itâ€™s needed.
Focus on Small Goals: Break the project into smaller parts (e.g., URL shortening, redirection) and complete each one before moving on.
Test Continuously: Verify each part as soon as you complete it to ensure the system works as expected.
